\subsubsection{Human Actors}
  Human actors will come in two forms: general and admin. General users will
  only be allowed to query and download images. Administrators, in addition to
  be able to query and download images, will also be able to upload, remove, and
  reorganize or relabel images.

\subsubsection{Non-human Actors}
  The application will also provide a computer-accessible endpoint, i.e. an API.
  This API will provide similar levels of access authentication as the human
  actor endpoints, meaning computers will be able to access the app as general
  users and as administrators.
