    The System will be made up of four main parts: the Database, the user interface, the controller, and a file watcher. The Database will consist of multiple projects (these projects contain pictures, text files and/or videos) that span across various dates and locations. The user interface gives the user the ability to query trough the database by date, project name, and various other paramiters. The controller will take the paramiters the user gives and convert them into somthing the database can use to find the requested files, after the database finds the files the controller then tells the UI what the files are so that it can display them. The file watcher will update the database whenever a file is added or removed.
    The type of architecture that would be used for the application is the MVC architecture style (slight between MVC and MVVM [model-view-viewModel]). The models sit in the MongoDB database, Meteor will serve as the controller and React will be used for the viewer.
