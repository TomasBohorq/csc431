The System will be made up of four main parts: the Database, the user interface,
the controller, and a file watcher. The Database will consist of multiple
projects (these projects contain pictures, text files and/or videos) that span
across various dates and locations. The user interface gives the user the
ability to query trough the database by date, project name, and various other
paramiters. The controller will take the parameters the user gives and convert
them into somthing the database can use to find the requested files, after the
database finds the files the controller then tells the UI what the files are so
that it can display them. The file watcher will update the database whenever a
file is added or removed.

The type of architecture used for the application is a mix between the MVC
(model view controller) and MVVM (model view view-model) styles. The models sit
in the MongoDB database; Meteor will serve as the controller, and React will be
used for the view.
