\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
  \label{system-constraints/budget-and-schedule/budget-title}
  This project has no budget, as no available funds have been provided by the
  client. The completion of this project is a requirement of the software
  engineering course (\texttt{CSC431}).

  \end{table}

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
  The application or a suitable working prototype must be completed before the
  end of the semester or grading period. Throughout the semester, we will follow
  the software development life cycle by completing all necessary phases of the
  SCRUM methodology.
