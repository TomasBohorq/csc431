\subsubsection{Web Application Front and Back Ends}
  \label{system-constraints/language/web-app}
  The front-facing UI will be written using the open-source Meteor platform on
  the Node.js runtime, as the project must be browser-based. Therefore,
  JavaScript is an absolute must and cannot be avoided.

\subsubsection{Back End Image Processing}
  Besides the back end associated with Meteor, as mentioned in Section
  \ref{system-constraints/language/web-app}, the application will require a
  back end to process uploaded images and data so as to make said information
  available to the web application. The languages in which this may be
  accomplished have no constraints and may evolve---such as in the form of a
  modular system---as the project progresses.

\subsubsection{Database Queries}
  \label{system-constraints/language/database}
  MongoDB is effectively required by Meteor. It is possible to use another type
  of database via an object relational mapping (ORM) like facebook's GraphQL or
  to hook it up with another version of noSQL, but such is \textit{not}
  recommended.
